# important: it is utmost important that both FL4RE_PUBLISH_BRANCH@HEAD and git tag of the new patched version
# are atomically commited.  We ensure this by checking out the branch and managing the changes ourselves (instead)
# of through 'npm version patch'.  If we could be guaranteed that 'npm publish' can return without failure, we can
# reduce this script to 2 lines of code i.e. version patch & npm publish.  But we make no such assumption.   
# The most important thing is nothing is commited to master while a publish is in progress

# since jenkins git plugin checks out to a headless branch, we need to indeed checkout to a named branch, master
# since later we will be comitting it
git checkout $FL4RE_PUBLISH_BRANCH
# merge whatever changes there still be from origin/master.  We do this because while the headless branch would 
# be latest cause that's how the plugin works on it, the named branch may not be.  Since origin/master is 
# definitely pulled, we can use it

# npm version patch w/o git actions and obtain the new patch version that appears in the changed package.json file
