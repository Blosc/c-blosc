===============================================================
 Announcing C-Blosc 1.21.1
 A blocking, shuffling and lossless compression library for C
===============================================================

What is new?
============

This is a maintenance release.  Fix pthread flag when linking on ppc64le.
Vendored BloscLZ, Zlib and Zstd codecs have been updated to their latest
versions too; this can bring important performance improvements, so if
speed is a priority to you, an upgrade is recommended.

For more info, please see the release notes in:

What is it?
===========

Blosc (http://www.blosc.org) is a high performance meta-compressor
optimized for binary data.  It has been designed to transmit data to
the processor cache faster than the traditional, non-compressed,
direct memory fetch approach via a memcpy() OS call.

Blosc has internal support for different compressors like its internal
BloscLZ, but also LZ4, LZ4HC, Snappy, Zlib and Zstd.  This way these can
automatically leverage the multithreading and pre-filtering
(shuffling) capabilities that comes with Blosc.
