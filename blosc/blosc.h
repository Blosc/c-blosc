/**
  Compress a block of data in the `src` buffer and returns the size of
  compressed block.  The size of `src` buffer is specified by
  `nbytes`.  There is not a minimum for `src` buffer size (`nbytes`).

  `clevel` is the desired compression level and must be a number
  between 0 (no compression) and 9 (maximum compression).

  `doshuffle` specifies whether the shuffle compression preconditioner
  should be applied or not.  0 means not applying it and 1 means
  applying it.

  `typesize` is the number of bytes for the atomic type in binary
  `src` buffer.  This is mainly useful for the shuffle preconditioner.
  Only a typesize > 1 will allow the shuffle to work.

  The `dest` buffer must have at least the size of `destsize`.  Blosc
  guarantees that if you set `destsize` to, at least,
  (`nbytes`+BLOSC_MAX_OVERHEAD), the compression will always succeed.
  The `src` buffer and the `dest` buffer can not overlap.

  If `src` buffer cannot be compressed into `destsize`, the return
  value is zero and you should discard the contents of the `dest`
  buffer.

  A negative return value means that an internal error happened.  This
  should never happen.  If you see this, please report it back
  together with the buffer data causing this and compression settings.

  Compression is memory safe and guaranteed not to write the `dest`
  buffer more than what is specified in `destsize`.  However, it is
  not re-entrant and not thread-safe (despite the fact that it uses
  threads internally).

  `dest` and returns the size of the decompressed block. If error
  occurs, e.g. the compressed data is corrupted or the output buffer

  returned instead.
